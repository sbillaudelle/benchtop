# benchtop üéõÔ∏è

Benchtop is a rather minimalistic collection of Python wrappers for PyVISA-compatible lab equipment.
It attempts to provide a streamlined interface for reproducible and remote experimentation with oscilloscopes, source measure units, and other measurement devices.

## Installation

To install *benchtop* from source, please execute

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

Benchtop's dependency `pyvisa` requires an additional backend that has to be installed separately.
Here, we recommend `pyvisa-py`.

## Examples

Please find a set of example scripts in the `examples` folder.
